The Views section describes all you need to know to configure data and views for a specific route in your Nuxt Application
 Views consist of an app template, a layout, and the actual page
 ou can define a default layout by adding a default
vue file inside the layouts directory
 This will be used for all pages that don't have a layout specified
 The only thing you need to include in the layout is the <Nuxt /> component which renders the page component
 You can create custom layouts by adding a 
vue file to the layouts directory
 In order to use the custom layout you need to set the layout property in the page component where you want to use that layout
 The value will be the name of the custom layout that you have created
 A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data
 These deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or temporal problems, such as language translation, natural language processing (nlp), speech recognition, and image captioning
 they are incorporated into popular applications such as Siri, voice search, and Google Translate
 Like feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks utilize training data to learn
 They are distinguished by their “memory” as they take information from prior inputs to influence the current input and output
 While traditional deep neural networks assume that inputs and outputs are independent of each other, the output of recurrent neural networks depend on the prior elements within the sequence
 While future events would also be helpful in determining the output of a given sequence, unidirectional recurrent neural networks cannot account for these events in their predictions
 Let’s take an idiom, such as “feeling under the weather”, which is commonly used when someone is ill, to aid us in the explanation of RNNs
 In order for the idiom to make sense, it needs to be expressed in that specific order
 As a result, recurrent networks need to account for the position of each word in the idiom and they use that information to predict the next word in the sequence
  Looking at the visual below, the “rolled” visual of the RNN represents the whole neural network, or rather the entire predicted phrase, like “feeling under the weather
” The “unrolled” visual represents the individual layers, or time steps, of the neural network
 Each layer maps to a single word in that phrase, such as “weather”
 Prior inputs, such as “feeling” and “under”, would be represented as a hidden state in the third timestep to predict the output in the sequence, “the”
The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of Asian cat
 Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century
The carefully refined, more extreme-featured, modern-style Siamese is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes a triangular head shape large ears an elongated, slender, and muscular body and various forms of point colouration Other than colouration, the modern-style Siamese bears little resemblance to the original stock, and the more moderate, traditional, or "old-style" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat; The International Cat Association describes the modern Siamese as affectionate, social, intelligent, and playful into adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch;[1] Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like companionship from other cats;

The Siamese (sometimes in the traditional form) is among the foundation stock of several other breeds developed by crossbreeding with other cats
some examples are the Oriental Shorthair and Colourpoint Shorthair, developed to expand the range of coat patterns
the long-haired variant most often dubbed the Himalayan
and hair-mutation breeds, including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald, and blue-point Siamese cat 
The Siamese cat comes in two distinct variations: traditional, with an apple-shaped head and a slightly chubby body; or the modern Siamese, which are very skinny and have a wedge-shaped head
The long-haired Siamese is recognized internationally as a Balinese cat
Siamese cats are one of the more common breeds to have different colors irises
