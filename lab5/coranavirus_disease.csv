Due to Covid-19 pandemic, mankind was affected with respect to mental and physical stress. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The causes of the disease have to be analysed based on the correlation factors such as Medication, Age, Gender, physical fitness and habits. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In this paper we have proposed a classification model based on weighted average dynamic time warping approach to detect the disease severity as High, Medium, and Low by considering the multi-variant dependent variables that affect the prediction of Covid-19 positive cases. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
We also proposed the forecasting model based on the time series exponential moving average to identify the growth of disease with respect to Age, Gender and Medical history of the covid-19 positive patient. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The results are obtained by defining the correlation function to measure the disease severity in the range of High, Medium and Low. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The time series analysis is done with respect to mean average disease severity and also number of positive cases. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The forecasting is performed based on the age, gender and existing disorders in health. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The results are analysed with other time series classification models such as weighted time wrapping to make the model fits maximum to the available input.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In view of the need to manage and forecast the number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds for critically ill COVID-19 patients, the Forecast UTI open access application was developed to enable hospital indicator monitoring based on past health data and the temporal dynamics of the Coronavirus epidemic. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Forecast UTI also enables short-term forecasts of the number of beds occupied daily by COVID-19 patients and possible care scenarios to be established. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
This article presents the functions, mode of access and examples of uses of Forecast UTI, a computational tool intended to assist managers of public and private hospitals within the Brazilian National Health System by supporting quick, strategic and efficient decision-making.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province in China, in December 2019, up until June 30th 2020, the disease has infected more than 10 million people and caused approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide.(1) ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In Brazil, according to official data, as at June 20th 2020, more than 1 million cases and 50,000 deaths had been recorded.(2);forecasting of coronavirus disease
"COVID-19 is known to be a highly transmissible disease, its prevention and control are restricted to non-pharmaceutical measures and there is no medication proven to be efficacious in curing the disease; vaccines to prevent it are still in the experimental stage. ";forecasting of coronavirus disease
In addition to asymptomatic infection, SARS-CoV-2 virus, the disease’s etiological agent, is capable of producing acute respiratory syndrome, varying between mild cases (around 80%) to very severe cases (between 5% and 10%), which develop respiratory insufficiency and require medical care in hospital. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
COVID-19 lethality, defined as the proportion of cases that die, varies according to age range and comorbidities of affected individuals, and is also influenced by health service capacity to provide care.(3);forecasting of coronavirus disease
In this context, one of the main uncertainties of Brazilian National Health System (SUS) hospital managers lies in forecasting the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds needed for severe cases of the disease, taking into consideration the epidemic’s temporal dynamics. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
With the aim of assisting Public Health decision-making, researchers have developed computerized tools(4)which, through the application of mathematical models, are able to estimate the daily number of new COVID-19 cases, based on distribution and severity of the disease, so as to be able to forecast its impact on capacity to provide ICU beds. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In short, these methods make short-term forecasts based on official health data and, by means of online applications, enable users to adjust those data according to local needs.(6);forecasting of coronavirus disease
Considering the unequal distribution of SUS hospital beds over the national territory and the fact of the COVID-19 epidemic being at different stages in the Brazilian municipalities and states, managing ICU beds is a challenge to be faced according to the specificities and realities of each health service territory.(8);forecasting of coronavirus disease
This paper presents the functions, mode of access and use of the Forecast UTI application, a computer tool capable of assisting public and private hospital managers within SUS to forecast the number of ICU beds needed for severe COVID-19 cases over a given time period, based on past health service data.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The digitization of the medical sector has led to an explosion of heterogeneous medical records. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The contribution of big data in the medical field is used to effectively address certain unsolved issues. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Effectively integrating and analyzing this big data can reveal many useful hidden medical information. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The COVID-19 virus, which first appeared in China at the end of 2019, is suffocating the rest of the world. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Traditional methods of preventing this unforeseen pandemic are the lengthy process that can take several years. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Now, the second wave of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc throughout the world. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The survival rate can be significantly increased by predicting the risk of COVID-19 infection based on the patient's early symptoms and health status. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Various disease forecasting approaches based on machine learning, and deep learning has been developed to forecast the severity rate of COVID-19. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
However, these approaches are becoming useless as the virus mutates. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In this proposed research, the prediction model is trained by the proposed Correlated Feature Extraction (CFE) method according to the virus behaviors. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Furthermore, two prediction models were established in this study. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The first model uses initial symptoms to forecast positive cases. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Second, based on the health status of the positive cases, the risk rate is estimated. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In this study, the disease is forecast by Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Networks (FFANN). ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Finally, a comparative study has been conducted with the recently developed COVID-19 disease prediction methods to demonstrate the training efficacy and accuracy of the proposed COVID-19 forecasting system.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Nowadays, automatic disease detection has become a crucial issue in medical science due to rapid population growth. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
An automatic disease detection framework assists doctors in the diagnosis of disease and provides exact, consistent, and fast results and reduces the death rate. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become one of the most severe and acute diseases in recent times and has spread globally. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Therefore, an automated detection system, as the fastest diagnostic option, should be implemented to impede COVID-19 from spreading. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
This paper aims to introduce a deep learning technique based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In this system, CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
A collection of 4575 X-ray images, including 1525 images of COVID-19, were used as a dataset in this system. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The experimental results show that our proposed system achieved an accuracy of 99.4%, AUC of 99.9%, specificity of 99.2%, sensitivity of 99.3%, and F1-score of 98.9%. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The system achieved desired results on the currently available dataset, which can be further improved when more COVID-19 images become available. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The proposed system can help doctors to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients easily.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Modelling the spread of coronavirus globally while learning trends at global and country levels remains crucial for tackling the pandemic. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
We introduce a novel variational-LSTM Autoencoder model to predict the spread of coronavirus for each country across the globe. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
This deep Spatio-temporal model does not only rely on historical data of the virus spread but also includes factors related to urban characteristics represented in locational and demographic data (such as population density, urban population, and fertility rate), an index that represents the governmental measures and response amid toward mitigating the outbreak (includes 13 measures such as: 1) school closing, 2) workplace closing, 3) cancelling public events, 4) close public transport, 5) public information campaigns, 6) restrictions on internal movements, 7) international travel controls, 8) fiscal measures, 9) monetary measures, 10) emergency investment in health care, 11) investment in vaccines, 12) virus testing framework, and 13) contact tracing). ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In addition, the introduced method learns to generate a graph to adjust the spatial dependences among different countries while forecasting the spread. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
We trained two models for short and long-term forecasts. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The first one is trained to output one step in future with three previous timestamps of all features across the globe, whereas the second model is trained to output 10 steps in future. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Overall, the trained models show high validation for forecasting the spread for each country for short and long-term forecasts, which makes the introduce method a useful tool to assist decision and policymaking for the different corners of the globe.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
COVID-19, responsible of infecting billions of people and economy across the globe, requires detailed study of the trend it follows to develop adequate short-term prediction models for forecasting the number of future cases. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In this perspective, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths as well as managing patients. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In this paper, proposed forecast models comprising autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), long shot term memory (LSTM), bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) are assessed for time series prediction of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries in ten major countries affected due to COVID-19. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The performance of models is measured by mean absolute error, root mean square error and r2_score indices. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In the majority of cases, Bi-LSTM model outperforms in terms of endorsed indices. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Models ranking from good performance to the lowest in entire scenarios is Bi-LSTM, LSTM, GRU, SVR and ARIMA. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Bi-LSTM generates lowest MAE and RMSE values of 0.0070 and 0.0077, respectively, for deaths in China. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The best r2_score value is 0.9997 for recovered cases in China. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
On the basis of demonstrated robustness and enhanced prediction accuracy, Bi-LSTM can be exploited for pandemic prediction for better planning and management.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from Wuhan, China to 213 countries across the globe. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
According to the WHO (World Health Organization) on February 17, 2020, that 80% of coronavirus patients have mild fever and recover, while 2% death rate is reported as compared to other corona diseases, named as SARS (2003) and MERS (2012-2019), that had death rate enclosing of 774 deaths from 8089 confirmed cases as 10% and 858 deaths from 2494 confirmed cases as 34%, respectively [1]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
On July 09, 2020, WHO proclaimed COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic including globally infected 559,694 deaths and 10,509,505 confirmed cases. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
"Region-wise this distribution depicts total deaths in Africa (7,559), Americas (272,606), Eastern Mediterranean (29,127), Europe (201,853), Asia (26,808) and Western Pacific as (7,515); while confirmed cases are (410,744), (6,125,802), (1,222,070), (2,847,887), (1,032,167), and (234,815) [1].";forecasting of coronavirus disease
To be precise, COVID-19 has followed specific patterns and these patterns are based on dynamic transmission of the epidemic. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
When it occurs, superseding measures of different methods are used to find and evaluate such infective diseases. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Any epidemic in a state or country has arisen with different aspect of magnitude with respect to time, particularly weather period changes and spread of virus over the time period, and exhibited as non-linear in nature. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
To capture these non-linear compelling changes, researchers have gained the attention and designed such non-linear systems to describe the abruptness of infective diseases [2]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Therefore, mathematical models such as SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) for analyzing the epidemics has been introduced [3]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
A transmission model with incubation time for malaria [4] and a deterministic model to analyze the interaction between HIV and tuberculosis is successfully developed to solve the nonlinear behavior of parameters [5]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Similar models of discrete time equations are used to control the infected population [6].;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Amid of physical and statistical methods, the difference is to learn the temporal behavior of data such as coronavirus and use of non-linear functions to predict the dynamics [7,8]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Usually statistical approaches are based on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model that is employed to predict the spread of epidemic trend COVID-2019 [9] and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model which estimates the fatality rate by use of time series analysis on influenza epidemic [10]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
These models have also been used to monitor and predict the dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases in southern Thailand [11] and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases in China to control diseases more effectively [12]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Another popular statistical model in the field of health care system is known as artificial intelligence (AI) based which is used to learn and train the COVID-19 dataset of Hubei Province in China to predict the epidemic peaks and trend size [13]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In numerous cases, these methods are not capable to fit actual data utterly and predicted accuracy is very low, while predicting the rise of COVID-19 spread.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In order to get better performance of statistical methods, machine learning (ML) models which cover several fields such as power and energy engineering [14], technology [15], psychology [16], is used for early prediction and real-time spread of data. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Recently, one of ML approach namely, infection size aware random forest (iSARF), observed by classification group has been proposed, which highlights the infection size and lung fields [17]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Other models are multilayer perceptron (MLP) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, (ANFIS) utilized for evaluating the complex variation behavior and predicting the COVID-19 transmission [18]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Hybrid approach of support vector regression (SVR) and ARIMA has been suggested to take the confirmed cases and give predictions related to the number of contaminated persons countrywide [19]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Furthermore, Parbat et al. employed SVR model with radial basis function (RBF) kernel method to forecast daily cases, recovered cases and death cases [20]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Hao has constructed the ensemble predictor of SVR and random forest (RF) to predict seven day ahead number of hospitalized patients [21].;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Deep learning (DL) algorithms show a vital role in the analysis and prediction of huge outbreak data patterns and help in early exploitation to stop the spread rate of coronavirus [22]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
COVID-19 is a time series data and vastly endorsed the use of sequential models to deal with its dynamic nature.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
 Bandyopadhyay et al. has proposed the gated recurrent neural network and long short term memory (LSTM) to evaluate the predictions with confirmed, negative released, and death cases of COVID-19 [23]. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Huang et al. have employed DL based convolutional neural network (CNN) model to estimate COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases [24].;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The novelty of the reported work lies in creating the three categories of confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases from dataset and intelligently developing a COVID-19 predictor to predict and analyze future trends of these three categories. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
This experiment is based on the data set of confirmed COVID-19 cases available until June 27, 2020. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Additionally, owing to the dynamic nature of coronavirus, ML and DL models have been implemented for early predictions.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Statistical models as ARIMA, ML technique of SVR with polynomial and RBF kernels, and DL mechanisms of LSTM, GRU and Bi-LSTM are proposed to predict the COVID-19 three categories, confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases for ten countries.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Accuracy of models is measured in terms of three performance measures, MAE, RMSE and r2_score.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Bi-LSTM time series model enhances the learning ability and memorizing the long sequence. Dl techniques in general and Bi-LSTM in specific are proposed for smallest prediction error and higher accuracy.;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In this work, two kinds of methodologies, statistical model and machine learning models including simple and deep learning techniques are established for COVID-19 predictions. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
In the first phase, design of ARIMA and SVR as simple ML algorithm are discussed, whereas in the next phase, description of various DL models are presented. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The statistical performance in terms of three error measures, MAE, RMSE and r2_score are also specified in this section for performance evaluation. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
The graphical overview of the proposed scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1, in which three categories (confirmed case, deaths cases and recovered cases) of data is collected and after preprocessing, data is passed to respective models separately and performance of models are measured through error measures. ;forecasting of coronavirus disease
ARIMA model comprises three processes named as auto regression, integration and moving average which is data independent and employed for model architecture and parameter estimation that is linear function for past observations and arbitrary error [25,26].;forecasting of coronavirus disease
Another effective time series implementation of support machine (SVM) anticipated by Vapnik is known as support vector regression [9].;forecasting of coronavirus disease
